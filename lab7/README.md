## Prior to attempting Lab 7, we assume …

- You’ve completed 431 Lab 1, and
- You’ve read sections 11 and 28-29 of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

# NEW! Completed Websites by Students in this year's class

- [Tatchaporn Ongphichetmetha](https://tatchaporn.github.io/tatchaporn/)
- [Atticus Kenny](https://atticus-kenny.github.io/atticuskenny/)


# What is this?

Lab 7 requires you to build a professional website, or augment your
current one, if you already have one.

This is, we hope, a worthwhile opportunity for you to build your own
professional website. Not only will this give you some additional
practice coding and using R and R-adjacent tools like Quarto, it’s a
low-cost and potentially high-yield method to establish your
professional presence online.

To complete Lab 7 successfully, you must submit a permanent URL from
which Dr. Love has to be able to open your website and read its
contents.

Note that should you want Dr. Love to write a letter of recommendation
for you in the future, he will be **much more willing** to do this if
you have an active website.

# Submitting your Website

Submit a link to your website to Dr. Love in an email with the subject
line **My Website** by the deadline specified in [the Course
Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/calendar.html). In the
body of your email, briefly tell me how you created the site (Quarto, or
something else.)

# Instructions and Guidance

We want you to build a professional looking website that will be useful
to you. The content is (mostly) up to you, but it’s worth considering
using this opportunity to craft your online presence.

## The Five Key Elements

Dr. Love will be happy if your site clearly includes at least the
following five elements:

1.  A front page including a photo of you or of something relevant to
    you.
2.  Links to your social media presence, if any, and a way for people to
    get in touch with you via email.
3.  An About Me or Welcome section on your front page, which briefly
    describes what you’re doing now.
4.  Some information on your Education, Experiences, and/or Projects
5.  A way to download your CV

A blog is also an appealing way to connect your thoughts with the world,
and including non-professional stuff is OK, too, of course.

# Using Quarto to Build the Site

Here are some resources that we think might be useful to you. If you
find others that are helpful, please share them with us.

- Marvin Schmitt provides a full tutorial and template at [Create Your
  Website with
  Quarto](https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/).
  The template [shown
  here](https://marvinschmitt.github.io/quarto-website-template/), for
  example, gives you a great example of what I’m looking for. This is
  the most common tool people who’ve completed this have mentioned to
  me.
- Quarto’s general guide to [Creating a
  Website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) may be helpful.
- The Quarto website shows you how to create a blog website within R
  Studio [in some detail
  here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html).
- Sam Csik has useful thoughts on [Creating your personal website using
  Quarto](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/)
- We found Drew Dimmery’s [Quarto for an Academic
  Website](https://ddimmery.com/posts/quarto-website/) interesting and
  useful.
- [Chi Zhang’s
  site](https://andreaczhang.github.io/qtwAcademic/articles/template_personal.html)
  provides a nice template for a personal site.

  minutes)
- Isabella Velásquez at RStudio has a YouTube video called [Building a

  over an hour)

  Github](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkrJrLs7xfbXcEKhTCKRSr2VXH4yiBeXo)

## Can I use something other than R / Quarto to build my site?

Yes, but you’ll receive less credit than a good Quarto site would
receive.

Good options to consider include [Owlstown](https://www.owlstown.com/),
and [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), and each offers templates that would
work nicely.

Follow whichever approach is best for you and you feel most comfortable
with. The key thing is to commit to making this a part of your life
going forward, however you most effectively do that.

## What if I already have an active website?

If it includes the five elements listed above, great! You should
definitely submit it to me as soon as possible.

## Should I spend a lot of money to have a fancy domain name?

No. There are many low-cost solutions if you want to register a domain
and use it for this purpose. Google Domains can provide you with most
available domains for something like \$1 per month. I wouldn’t go much
above that, and a free name is even better.

## Do I need to wait until the end of the term to work on this?

Not at all. I would expect most of you to be able to follow the
templates and guides above to do the work once you’ve finished Lab 1. At
the end of the term, you will have a lot of work to do, so getting to
this early is definitely a good idea.

## Will the TAs help me troubleshoot my website?

If they can, sure, but only after anyone else looking for 431 help has
had their problem settled. I do not guarantee that we can help fix your
website problems.

## Grading Lab 7

- Lab 7 is worth 25 points.
- Students will receive all 25 points if their ...
    - Lab 7 submission is on time,
    - Lab 7 site was built using Quarto,
    - Lab 7 site clearly includes [the five key elements listed above](#the-five-key-elements)
    - Lab 7 site has no unfixed typos or grammatical issues that Dr. Love notices in his review.
- Students will receive a maximum of 22.5/25 points if their site was built using something other than Quarto, but otherwise meets these standards.


## Are there examples from past students?

Yes. Visit [this
link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2024/tree/main/lab8#approved-lab-8-submissions-so-far)
for some student websites from people who took 432 this past Spring.
